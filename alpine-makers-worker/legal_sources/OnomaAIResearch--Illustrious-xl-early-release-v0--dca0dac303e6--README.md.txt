      Illustrious XL is the Illustration focused Stable Diffusion XL model which is continued from Kohaku XL Beta 5, trained by OnomaAI Research Team.
      The model focuses on utilizing large-scale annotated dataset, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyanko7/danbooru2023">Danbooru2023.</a>
      We release the v0.1 and v0.1-GUIDED model here, under fair public ai license, however discourages the usage of model over monetization purpose / any closed source purposes.
      For full technical details, please refer to our technical report.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Model Information:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> Illustrious-XL-v0.1</li>
      <li><strong>Model Type:</strong> Stable Diffusion XL Model</li>
      <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Fine-tuned on Danbooru2023 Dataset</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Description</strong>: 
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Illustrious-XL</strong> is a powerful generative model series, fine-tuned on the comprehensive Danbooru2023 dataset and its variants. It includes a wide variety of character designs, styles, and artistic knowledge derived from the dataset, making it suitable for creative and artistic AI generation tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Illustrious-XL-v0.1</strong> is untuned BASE model, which works as possible base for all future model variants. LoRAs / Adapters can be trained on this model, ensuring future usecases. The model is research-only purpose, as not tuned for aesthetics / preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Illustrious-XL-v0.1-GUIDED</strong> is minimally safety controlled model, which works as better option for usual usecases.</li>
    </ul>
    We plan to release several aesthetic-finetuned model variants in near future.

      <strong>Training/Merging Policy:</strong><br>
      You may fine-tune, merge, or train LoRA based on this model. However, to foster an open-source community, you are required to:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li>Openly share details of any derived models, including references to the original model licensed under the fair-ai-public-license.</li>
      <li>Provide information on datasets and "merge recipes" used for fine-tuning or training.</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Monetization Prohibition:</strong>
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>You are prohibited from monetizing any <strong>close-sourced fine-tuned / merged model, which disallows the public from accessing the model's source code / weights and its usages.</strong></li>
        <li>As per the license, you must openly publish any derivative models and variants. This model is intended for open-source use, and all derivatives must follow the same principles.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Usage:</strong><br>
      We do not recommend overusing critical composition tags such as 'close-up', 'upside-down', or 'cowboy shot', as they can be conflicting and lead to confusion, affecting model results.<br>
      Recommended sampling method: Euler a, Sampling Steps: 20–28, CFG: 5–7.5 (may vary based on use case).<br>
      We suggest using suitable composition tags like "upper body," "cowboy shot," "portrait," or "full body" depending on your use case.<br>
      The model supports quality tags such as: "worst quality," "bad quality," "average quality," "good quality," "best quality," and "masterpiece (quality)."<br>
      Note: The model does not have any default style. This is intended behavior for the base model.

# Illustrious XL Series Update

It’s been a while since we released **Illustrious XL v0.1**, and we know many of you have been eagerly waiting for updates. We also recognize that many are disappointed with the closed-source nature of **Illustrious XL v1.0**, and we want to address this directly. A lot has happened since then, and we’re truly grateful for the open-source community’s contributions—whether it’s large-scale fine-tuned models, ControlNets, or the countless LoRAs and adapters that have been developed.

---

## Development Journey

When we started working on the Illustrious XL series, our goal was simple: there weren’t any strong pretrained models available for illustrations, so we decided to build one ourselves—a pretrain-level fine-tuned model that artists and researchers could actually use.

We also knew that keeping everything in-house wouldn’t help the field move forward. That’s why we released **v0.1** to the public and focused on training newer variations, pushing the model’s capabilities further with improved quality, deeper knowledge, and architectural refinements.

Along the way, we discovered something unexpected. The model wasn’t just good at illustrations—it could also interpret natural language, handle complex prompts, and generate high-resolution images, far beyond what we originally planned.

---

## Our Model Versions

- **v0.1 (trained in May 2024)**
- **v1.0 (July 2024)**
- **v1.1 (August 2024)**
- **v2.0 (September 2024)**
- **v3 (November 2024)**
- **v3.5 (a special variant incorporating Google’s v-parameterization)**

These models take another step forward in natural language composition and image generation.

That said, we can’t drop everything all at once. There’s a clear roadmap ahead, and open-source releases are part of it. But rather than rushing, we want to do this the right way—with explanations, insights, and research-backed improvements.

---

## Our Future Plans

Now, after months of work behind the scenes, we’re finally ready to move forward. We’ll be rolling out our latest models step by step while progressively open-sourcing previous versions so they can be studied and improved upon. Expect breakthroughs like **true 2K-resolution generation** and better natural language alignment along the way.

---

## Commitment to Open Source

This will take time, but we’re moving fast. Our next-generation models are already in development, tackling some of the fundamental limitations of the base SD XL architecture. As we progress, older models will naturally be deprecated, and weight releases will follow accordingly. Our team aims to proceed thoughtfully, ensuring that each release is accompanied by comprehensive explanations and insights.

---

## Backward Compatibility

One last thing—we’re not just here to release models. Every model we’ve built is designed with backward compatibility in mind, because Illustrious XL wasn’t just about making something new—it was about creating a better foundation for fine-tuning. That’s why we’ve put so much effort into training LoRAs properly, and soon, we’ll be sharing insights on how to train them more effectively.

---

## Summary

In summary, **Onoma AI** plans to roll out open-source weights step by step and encourages the community to stay tuned for upcoming developments—we’re just getting started.
