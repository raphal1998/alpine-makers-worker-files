# **SDXL Flash** *in collaboration with [Project Fluently](https://hf.co/fluently)*

![preview](images/preview.png)

Introducing the new fast model SDXL Flash, we learned that all fast XL models work fast, but the quality decreases, and we also made a fast model, but it is not as fast as LCM, Turbo, Lightning and Hyper, but the quality is higher. Below you will see the study with steps and cfg.

### Steps and CFG (Guidance)

![steps_and_cfg_grid_test](images/steps_cfg_grid.png)

### Optimal settings
- **Steps**: 6-9
- **CFG Scale**: 2.5-3.5
- **Sampler**: DPM++ SDE

### Diffusers usage

```bash
pip install torch diffusers
```

```py
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline, DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler

# Load model.
pipe = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained("sd-community/sdxl-flash", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")

# Ensure sampler uses "trailing" timesteps.
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverSinglestepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config, timestep_spacing="trailing")

# Image generation.
pipe("a happy dog, sunny day, realism", num_inference_steps=7, guidance_scale=3).images[0].save("output.png")
```
