# Chroma1-HD

Chroma1-HD is an **8.9B** parameter text-to-image foundational model based on **FLUX.1-schnell**. It is fully **Apache 2.0 licensed**, ensuring that anyone can use, modify, and build upon it.

As a **base model**, Chroma1 is intentionally designed to be an excellent starting point for **finetuning**. It provides a strong, neutral foundation for developers, researchers, and artists to create specialized models.

for the fast CFG "baked" version please go to [Chroma1-Flash](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma1-Flash).

### Key Features
*   **High-Performance Base:** 8.9B parameters, built on the powerful FLUX.1 architecture.
*   **Easily Finetunable:** Designed as an ideal checkpoint for creating custom, specialized models.
*   **Community-Driven & Open-Source:** Fully transparent with an Apache 2.0 license, and training history.

## How to Use

### `diffusers` Library

install the requirements 

`pip install transformers diffusers sentencepiece accelerate`

```python
import torch
from diffusers import ChromaPipeline

pipe = ChromaPipeline.from_pretrained("lodestones/Chroma1-HD", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = [
    "A high-fashion close-up portrait of a blonde woman in clear sunglasses. The image uses a bold teal and red color split for dramatic lighting. The background is a simple teal-green. The photo is sharp and well-composed, and is designed for viewing with anaglyph 3D glasses for optimal effect. It looks professionally done."
]
negative_prompt =  ["low quality, ugly, unfinished, out of focus, deformed, disfigure, blurry, smudged, restricted palette, flat colors"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    generator=torch.Generator("cpu").manual_seed(433),
    num_inference_steps=40,
    guidance_scale=3.0,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
).images[0]
image.save("chroma.png")
```

Quantized inference using gemlite

```py

pipe = ChromaPipeline.from_pretrained("lodestones/Chroma1-HD", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

ComfyUI
For advanced users and customized workflows, you can use Chroma with ComfyUI.

**Requirements:**
*   A working ComfyUI installation.
*   [Chroma checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma) (latest version).
*   [T5 XXL Text Encoder](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/t5xxl_fp16.safetensors).
*   [FLUX VAE](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma/resolve/main/ae.safetensors).
*   [Chroma Workflow JSON](https://huggingface.co/lodestones/Chroma1-HD/resolve/main/ComfyUI_Chroma1-HD_T2I-workflow.json).

![Chroma Workflow](./ComfyUI_Chroma1-HD_T2I-sample.png)
![Workflow Overview](./ComfyUI_Chroma1-HD_T2I-overview.png)

**Setup:**
1.  Place the `T5_xxl` model in your `ComfyUI/models/clip` folder.
2.  Place the `FLUX VAE` in your `ComfyUI/models/vae` folder.
3.  Place the `Chroma checkpoint` in your `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models` folder.
4.  Load the Chroma workflow file into ComfyUI and run.

## Model Details
*   **Architecture:** Based on the 8.9B parameter FLUX.1-schnell model.
*   **Training Data:** Trained on a 5M sample dataset curated from a 20M pool, including artistic, photographic, and niche styles.
*   **Technical Report:** A comprehensive technical paper detailing the architectural modifications and training process is forthcoming.

## Intended Use
Chroma is intended to be used as a **base model** for researchers and developers to build upon. It is ideal for:
*   Finetuning on specific styles, concepts, or characters.
*   Research into generative model behavior, alignment, and safety.
*   As a foundational component in larger AI systems.

## Limitations and Bias Statement
Chroma is trained on a broad, filtered dataset from the internet. As such, it may reflect the biases and stereotypes present in its training data. The model is released in a state as is and has not been aligned with a specific safety filter.

Users are responsible for their own use of this model. It has the potential to generate content that may be considered harmful, explicit, or offensive. I encourage developers to implement appropriate safeguards and ethical considerations in their downstream applications.

## Summary of Architectural Modifications
*(For a full breakdown, tech report soon-ish.)*

*   **12B → 8.9B Parameters:**
    *   **TL;DR:** I replaced a 3.3B parameter timestep-encoding layer with a more efficient 250M parameter FFN, as the original was vastly oversized for its task.
*   **MMDiT Masking:**
    *   **TL;DR:** Masking T5 padding tokens enhanced fidelity and increased training stability by preventing the model from focusing on irrelevant `<pad>` tokens.
*   **Custom Timestep Distributions:**
    *   **TL;DR:** I implemented a custom timestep sampling distribution (`-x^2`) to prevent loss spikes and ensure the model trains effectively on both high-noise and low-noise regions.

## P.S
Chroma1-HD is not the old Chroma-v.50 it has been retrained from v.48
